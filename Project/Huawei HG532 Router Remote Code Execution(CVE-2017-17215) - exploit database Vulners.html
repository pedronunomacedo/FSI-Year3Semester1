However, whereas they score high on convenience, the latest discoveries from Check Point Research shows they still have a lot of homework to do to get their security score up to par.\r\n\r\n### The Attack\r\n\r\nOn 23rd November, Check Point Researchers noticed some of Check Point\u2019s sensors and honey-pots were generating suspicious security alerts. Upon further inspection, they saw numerous attacks running over port 37215 exploiting an unknown vulnerability in Huawei HG532 devices. The same pattern of attack was being demonstrated in our sensors across the world, most notably in the USA, Italy, Germany and Egypt, to name a few.Huawei Router Botnet\r\n\r\nAs soon as our analysts had confirmed the findings, we [disclosed](http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-notices/huawei-sn-20171130-01-hg532-en) the vulnerability to Huawei discretely so as to mitigate further propagation.\r\n\r\nThanks to the fast and effective communication by the Huawei security team, they were able to quickly patch the vulnerability and update their customers. In parallel our teams developed and released an IPS [protection](https://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2017/cpai-2017-1016.html), making sure Check Point\u2019s customers were also the first to be protected.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121768221)\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Global Attacks\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Zero-Day (CVE-2017-17215)\r\n\r\nHuawei Home Gateway applies the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. Via the TR-064 technical report standard, the protocol is widely used in embedded devices to connect seamlessly and simplify the implementation of networks in home and corporate environments.\r\n\r\nTR-064 was designed and intended for local network configuration. For example, it allows an engineer to implement basic device configuration, firmware upgrades and more from within the internal network.\r\n\r\nIn this case though, the TR-064 implementation in the Huawei devices was exposed to WAN through port 37215 (UPnP).\r\n\r\nFrom looking into the UPnP description of the device, it can be seen that it supports a service type named `DeviceUpgrade`. This service is supposedly carrying out a firmware upgrade action by sending a request to \u201c/ctrlt/DeviceUpgrade_1\u201d (referred to as controlURL ) and is carried out with two elements  named `NewStatusURL` and `NewDownloadURL`.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability allows remote administrators to execute arbitrary commands by injecting shell meta-characters \u201c$()\u201d in the NewStatusURL and NewDownloadURL as can be seen below.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121805333)\r\n\r\nFigure 2: The Attack Vector\r\n\r\nAfter these have been executed, the exploit returns the default HUAWEIUPNP message, and the \u2018upgrade\u2019 is initiated.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121827380)\r\n\r\nFigure 3: The attack involves a command injection, where the malicious payload is downloaded and executed on the vulnerable device.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121854810)\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121864851)\r\n\r\nFigure 4: VirusTotal Detection Rate for the downloaded payload \u2013 Now and Then\r\n\r\n\r\n### How It Works\r\n\r\nThe payload is quite simple in its functionality. The main purpose of the bot is to flood targets with manually crafted UDP or TCP packets.\r\n\r\nWhen started, the bot tries to resolve the IP address of a C&amp;C server using DNS request with the hardcoded domain name. Then the bot takes addresses from the DNS response and tries to connect using TCP protocol with the hardcoded target port (7645 in the researched sample).\r\n\r\nAs with the Mirai botnet, the DNS name and other strings are decoded using a simple XOR operation with the value 0x07.\r\n\r\nThe payload also contains a non-encoded string with the fake C&amp;C domain that is never used:\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121893137)\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Real encrypted and fake C&amp;C domains\r\n\r\n The number of packets used for the flooding action and their corresponding parameters are transmitted from the C&amp;C server:\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121913804)\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Parsing data received from C&amp;C server\r\n\r\nAlso, the C&amp;C server can pass an individual IP for attack or a subnet using a subnet address and a number of valuable bits (C pseudocode):\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514121934159)\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Random IP address generation for a given subnet\r\n\r\nAfter sending packets, the bot does not wait for any answer from the attacked hosts.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the bot\u2019s binary contains a lot of unused, both obfuscated and plain, text strings that are never used. Most likely, they are just a legacy from another bot or a previous version.\r\n\r\n### C&amp;C Traffic\r\n\r\nFor the C&amp;C communication, the bot uses its own custom protocol.

The answers were not what we expected.\r\n\r\nDue to an impressive volume of traffic, an unknown Zero-Day and multiple attack servers, the identity of the attacker was initially a mystery, with speculations running from advanced nation state perpetrators to notorious threat gangs.\r\n\r\nEventually, we arrived at our main suspect; a threat actor under the nickname \u2018Nexus Zeta\u2019, who was found thanks to the email address used to register a C&amp;C domain belonging to the botnet \u2013 nexusiotsolutions[.]net.\r\n\r\nThe email address \u2013 nexuszeta1337@gmail[.]com \u2013 which shows some attribution to the domain, raised our suspicions that this is not just a disposable email address, but rather an address that could shed light on the attacker\u2019s identity. When searching for Nexus Zeta 1337 we found an active threat actor on HackForums carrying the avatar name \u2018Nexus Zeta\u2019, and who has been a HackForums member since August \u201915. Although he is rarely active in such forums, the few posts he does make disclose an less professional actor, though interestingly his most recent focus was on an initiative to establish a Mirai-like IoT botnet.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514122044705)\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Example of Nexus Zeta\u2019s Activity on HackForums\r\n\r\n\u2018NexusZeta\u2019 is also somewhat active on social media, most notably Twitter and Github, both of which serve his IoT botnet project. Indeed, he has also proceeded to link his Github account to the aforementioned malicious domain nexusiotsolutions[.]net. We also came across his Skype and SoundCloud accounts which are in the name of Caleb Wilson (caleb.wilson37 / Caleb Wilson 37), though it cannot be determined whether this is his real name.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514122079842)\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Nexus Zeta\u2019s Twitter Account\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514122091403)\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Nexus Zeta\u2019s Github Account\r\n\r\nNexus Zeta\u2019s activity on HackForums provides an interesting glimpse into the attacker\u2019s point of view. Between 23rd \u2013 26th November, while our sensors were monitoring his malicious activity, he was at that same time active in Hackforums with a peculiarly interesting post (23rd November):\r\n\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1514122102751)\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Nexus Zeta\u2019s Post Prior to the Attack\r\n\r\n\u201chello, im looking for someone to help me compile the mirai botnet, i heard all you have to do is compile it and you have access to 1 terabit per second so please help me setup a mirai tel-net botnet\u201d.\r\n\r\nAccording to our investigation, Nexus Zeta does not seem to be as much of an advanced actor as we initially suspected but rather an amateur with lots of motivation, looking for the crowd\u2019s wisdom. It is worth mentioning however that unfortunately we cannot determine how the Zero-Day found its way to his possession.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, as seen in this case as well as others over the past year, it is clear that a combination of leaked malware code together with exploitable and poor IoT security, when used by unskilled hackers, can lead to disastrous results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### IPS &amp; Anti-Bot Prevention\r\n\r\nOur IPS and Anti-Bot Protections have successfully blocked attempts to exploit this vulnerability from day 0. We continue to monitor and research any additional attacks in the wild.\r\n\r\n### IPS 0-Day protection:\r\n* Huawei HG532 Router Remote Code Execution\r\n\r\n### Anti-Bot protections:\r\n* Linux.OKIRU.A\r\n* Linux.OKIRU.B&quot;, &quot;sourceHref&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;reporter&quot;: &quot;Root&quot;, &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://www.seebug.org/vuldb/ssvid-97010&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;seebug&quot;, &quot;viewCount&quot;: 1054, &quot;references&quot;: [], &quot;lastseen&quot;: &quot;2017-12-25T18:38:01&quot;, &quot;published&quot;: &quot;2017-12-24T00:00:00&quot;, &quot;cvelist&quot;: [&quot;CVE-2017-17215&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;SSV:97010&quot;, &quot;enchantments_done&quot;: [], &quot;modified&quot;: &quot;2017-12-24T00:00:00&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Huawei HG532 Router Remote Code Execution(CVE-2017-17215)&quot;, &quot;cvss&quot;: {&quot;score&quot;: 0.0, &quot;vector&quot;: &quot;NONE&quot;}, &quot;bulletinFamily&quot;: &quot;exploit&quot;, &quot;enchantments&quot;: {&quot;score&quot;: {&quot;value&quot;: 0.0, &quot;vector&quot;: &quot;NONE&quot;}, &quot;dependencies&quot;: {&quot;references&quot;: [{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;attackerkb&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;AKB:66A7AC29-1EFE-4403-ACF3-15013CC8E0AB&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;checkpoint_advisories&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;CPAI-2017-1016&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;cve&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;CVE-2017-17215&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;myhack58&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;MYHACK58:62201890050&quot;, &quot;MYHACK58:62201892188&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;nessus&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;HUAWEI_CMD_EXEC.NBIN&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;thn&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;THN:5F3B88275916814D404574163A140C61&quot;, &quot;THN:9F0AC4ABC4A83921D5A1669A0BEFAD87&quot;, &quot;THN:E0AEE6699886531A72F2EB5D650D31E1&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;threatpost&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;THREATPOST:19F72FE56FF4813F1D3C849D2AB4BDAD&quot;, &quot;THREATPOST:1E765B1FCA5C193278D6E5A1951FF4BF&quot;, &quot;THREATPOST:4C2D088C37CAF9E8959CD8833D4B2668&quot;, &quot;THREATPOST:58600E628B858CCDB55A42CF867B1CF7&quot;, &quot;THREATPOST:9CC8C9C750EB5EFD6E67DD7C0C8549FB&quot;, &quot;THREATPOST:D01E39B118AD961C99A79B4280C13B6A&quot;, &quot;THREATPOST:DC4DAA2C2F91148A88C3494B6E55F309&quot;]}]}, &quot;backreferences&quot;: {&quot;references&quot;: [{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;attackerkb&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;AKB:66A7AC29-1EFE-4403-ACF3-15013CC8E0AB&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;checkpoint_advisories&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;CPAI-2017-1016&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;cve&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;CVE-2017-17215&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;myhack58&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;MYHACK58:62201890050&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;nessus&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;HUAWEI_CMD_EXEC.NBIN&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;thn&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;THN:E0AEE6699886531A72F2EB5D650D31E1&quot;]}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;threatpost&quot;, &quot;idList&quot;: [&quot;THREATPOST:19F72FE56FF4813F1D3C849D2AB4BDAD&quot;]}]}, &quot;exploitation&quot;: null, &quot;vulnersScore&quot;: 0.0}, &quot;immutableFields&quot;: [], &quot;cvss2&quot;: {}, &quot;cvss3&quot;: {}, &quot;_state&quot;: {&quot;dependencies&quot;: 1659976447, &quot;score&quot;: 1659978068}, &quot;_internal&quot;: {&quot;score_hash&quot;: &quot;2e210d45fcaace1b23ec10e2e0cecac2&quot;}}

who turned out Kenneth Currin Schuchman after the FBI&#x27;s investigation.  \n  \n\&quot;Cybercriminals depend on anonymity, but remain visible in the eyes of justice,\&quot; said U.S. Attorney Schroder. \&quot;Today&#x27;s sentencing should serve as a reminder that together with our law enforcement and private sector partners, we have the ability and resolve to find and bring to justice those that prey on Alaskans and victims across the United States.\&quot;   \n  \n\&quot;Cyber-attacks pose serious harm to Alaskans, especially those in our more remote communities. The increasing number of Internet-connected devices presents challenges to our network security and our daily lives,\&quot; said Special Agent in Charge Robert W. Britt of the FBI&#x27;s Anchorage Field Office.  \n  \n\&quot;The FBI Anchorage Field Office will continue to work tirelessly alongside our partners to combat those criminals who use these devices to cause damage globally, as well as right here in our own neighborhoods.\&quot;  \n  \nSchuchman and his associates Sterritt, a 20-year-old U.K national, also known as \&quot;Vamp,\&quot; or \&quot;Viktor\&quot; and Shwydiuk, a 31-year-old Canadian national, also known as \&quot;Drake,\&quot; have also been charged for their roles in developing and operating these botnets to conduct DDoS attacks.  \n  \nSchuchman has been sentenced by Chief U.S. District Judge Timothy M. Burgess after he pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and related activity in connection with computers, in violation of the Computer Fraud &amp;amp; Abuse Act.  \n  \nSchuchman has also been ordered to serve a term of 18 months of community confinement and drug treatment, following his release from prison and a three-year term of supervised release.\n&quot;, &quot;cvss3&quot;: {&quot;exploitabilityScore&quot;: 2.8, &quot;cvssV3&quot;: {&quot;baseSeverity&quot;: &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;confidentialityImpact&quot;: &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;attackComplexity&quot;: &quot;LOW&quot;, &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;UNCHANGED&quot;, &quot;attackVector&quot;: &quot;NETWORK&quot;, &quot;availabilityImpact&quot;: &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;integrityImpact&quot;: &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;privilegesRequired&quot;: &quot;LOW&quot;, &quot;baseScore&quot;: 8.8, &quot;vectorString&quot;: &quot;CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;3.0&quot;, &quot;userInteraction&quot;: &quot;NONE&quot;}, &quot;impactScore&quot;: 5.9}, &quot;published&quot;: &quot;2020-06-26T13:53:00&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;thn&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Satori&#x27;

is exploiting a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-17215) in Huawei HG532 devices, according to a new [report](&lt;https://research.checkpoint.com/good-zero-day-skiddie/&gt;) published Thursday by Check Point.  \n\n\n[![Satori-Okiku-Mirai-IoT-Botnet](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kjy3A3dDwt0/Wj4O7DdO5FI/AAAAAAAAvUI/QRZBcqfHUzU_LakYAIKxqV0psUL4x49CQCLcBGAs/s1600/Satori-Okiku-Mirai-IoT-Botnet.png)](&lt;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kjy3A3dDwt0/Wj4O7DdO5FI/AAAAAAAAvUI/QRZBcqfHUzU_LakYAIKxqV0psUL4x49CQCLcBGAs/s1600/Satori-Okiku-Mirai-IoT-Botnet.png&gt;)\n\nThe vulnerability is due to the fact that the implementation of the TR-064 (technical report standard), an application layer protocol for remote management, in the Huawei devices was exposed on the public Internet through Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol at port 37215.  \n\n\n&gt; \&quot;TR-064 was designed and intended for local network configuration,\&quot; the report reads. \&quot;For example, it allows an engineer to implement basic device configuration, firmware upgrades and more from within the internal network.\&quot;\n\nSince this vulnerability allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands to the device, attackers were found exploiting this flaw to download and execute the malicious payload on the Huawei routers and upload Satori botnet.  \n  \nIn the Satori attack, each bot is instructed to flood targets with manually crafted UDP or TCP packets.  \n\n\n&gt; \&quot;The number of packets used for the flooding action and their corresponding parameters are transmitted from the C&amp;amp;C server,\&quot; researchers said. \&quot;Also, the C&amp;amp;C server can pass an individual IP for attack or a subnet using a subnet address and a number of valuable bits.\&quot;\n\nAlthough the researchers observed a flurry of attacks worldwide against the Huawei HG532 devices, the most targeted countries include the United States, Italy, Germany, and Egypt.  \n  \nCheck Point researchers \&quot;discretely\&quot; disclosed the vulnerability to Huawei as soon as their findings were confirmed, and the company confirmed the vulnerability and issued an updated security notice to customers on Friday.  \n\n\n&gt; \&quot;An authenticated attacker could send malicious packets to port 37215 to launch attacks. Successful exploit could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code,\&quot; Huawei said in its security [advisory](&lt;http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-notices/huawei-sn-20171130-01-hg532-en&gt;).\n\nThe company also offered some mitigations that could circumvent or prevent the exploit, which included using the built-in firewall function, changing the default credentials of their devices, and deploying a firewall at the carrier side.  \n  \nUsers can also deploy Huawei NGFWs (Next Generation Firewall) or data center firewalls, and upgrade their IPS signature database to the latest IPS_H20011000_2017120100 version released on December 1, 2017, in order to detect and defend against this flaw.\n&quot;, &quot;cvss3&quot;: {}, &quot;published&quot;: &quot;2017-12-22T21:43:00&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;thn&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Satori IoT Botnet Exploits Zero-Day to Zombify Huawei Routers&quot;, &quot;bulletinFamily&quot;: &quot;info&quot;, &quot;cvss2&quot;: {}, &quot;cvelist&quot;: [&quot;CVE-2017-17215&quot;], &quot;modified&quot;: &quot;2018-01-15T09:42:57&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;THN:E0AEE6699886531A72F2EB5D650D31E1&quot;, &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://thehackernews.com/2017/12/satori-mirai-iot-botnet.html&quot;, &quot;cvss&quot;: {&quot;score&quot;: 0.0, &quot;vector&quot;: &quot;NONE&quot;}}, {&quot;lastseen&quot;: &quot;2022-09-29T08:04:26&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;[![](https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBWtMbIYj48YeZXsqul94H3rYouHSTaprVh8tRsYEZhign-iSQ6eXMKv42gCdN6uZBaSmiP6Jgdx3T6x3xQz2AiTAUcXa7SMyOMP0Bg_0TZ6Zr76LaJ7xxaGIpNwK76CIPzpEo01bZvySygsysCgCXPdiNwWG8E6diMUNwpqI7QrVc0Dqnbnr_01CK/s728-e100/ransomware-malware.jpg)](&lt;https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBWtMbIYj48YeZXsqul94H3rYouHSTaprVh8tRsYEZhign-iSQ6eXMKv42gCdN6uZBaSmiP6Jgdx3T6x3xQz2AiTAUcXa7SMyOMP0Bg_0TZ6Zr76LaJ7xxaGIpNwK76CIPzpEo01bZvySygsysCgCXPdiNwWG8E6diMUNwpqI7QrVc0Dqnbnr_01CK/s728-e100/ransomware-malware.jpg&gt;)\n\nA new, multi-functional Go-based malware dubbed **Chaos** has been rapidly growing in volume in recent months to ensnare a wide range of Windows, Linux, small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and enterprise servers into its botnet.\n\n\&quot;Chaos functionality includes the ability to enumerate the host environment, run remote shell commands, load additional modules, automatically propagate through stealing and brute-forcing SSH private keys, as well as launch DDoS attacks,\&quot; researchers from Lumen&#x27;s Black Lotus Labs [said](&lt;https://blog.lumen.com/chaos-is-a-go-based-swiss-army-knife-of-malware/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=referral&gt;) in a write-up shared with The Hacker News.\n\nA majority of the bots are located in Europe, specifically Italy, with other infections reported in China and the U.S., collectively representing \&quot;hundreds of unique IP addresses\&quot; over a one-month time period from mid-June through mid-July 2022.\n\nWritten in Chinese and leveraging China-based infrastructure for command-and-control, the botnet joins a long list of malware that are designed to establish persistence for extended periods and likely abuse the foothold for nefarious purposes, such as DDoS attacks and cryptocurrency mining.\n\nIf anything, the development also points to a dramatic uptick in threat actors shifting to programming languages like Go to evade detection and render reverse engineering difficult, not to mention targeting several platforms at once.\n\nChaos (not to be confused with the [ransomware builder](&lt;https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/new-chaos-ransomware-builder-variant.html&gt;) of the same name) lives up to its name by exploiting known security vulnerabilities to gain initial access, subsequently abusing it to conduct reconnaissance and initiate lateral movement across the compromised network.\n\n[![](https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkDThSg2gZRJzWfHsEGm7s2uBy9oK_Z1oUVE9dvEjq_RcBKbwu0dYC5C_2F1HehdptqEtZEzZ5AaA8QvlmMkMF4JqGYEReyB2ZempsB3ILmuOtUD6QmVNtGwwO6Qq-DNMVdN8bGPzLhe-n29vPDVdIbNmWgWPf0olJRmmzTzRC_mmNs9IuG92SR2ya/s728-e100/map.jpg)](&lt;https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkDThSg2gZRJzWfHsEGm7s2uBy9oK_Z1oUVE9dvEjq_RcBKbwu0dYC5C_2F1HehdptqEtZEzZ5AaA8QvlmMkMF4JqGYEReyB2ZempsB3ILmuOtUD6QmVNtGwwO6Qq-DNMVdN8bGPzLhe-n29vPDVdIbNmWgWPf0olJRmmzTzRC_mmNs9IuG92SR2ya/s728-e100/map.jpg&gt;)\n\nWhat&#x27;s more, the malware has versatility that similar malware does not, enabling it to operate across a wide range of instruction set architectures from ARM, Intel (i386), MIPS, and PowerPC, effectively allowing the threat actor to broaden the scope of its targets and swiftly accrue in volume.\n\nOn top of that, Chaos further has the ability to execute as many as 70 different commands sent from the C2 server, one of which is an instruction to trigger the exploitation of publicly-disclosed flaws ([CVE-2017-17215](&lt;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-17215&gt;) and [CVE-2022-30525](&lt;https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/watch-out-hackers-begin-exploiting.html&gt;)) defined in a file.\n\nAn analysis of around 100 samples discovered in the wild dates the earliest evidence of the botnet activity to April 2022. The malware has since been observed targeting not only enterprise servers and large organizations but also devices that are not regularly monitored, such as SOHO routers and FreeBSD OS.\n\nChaos is also believed to be an evolution of another Go-based DDoS malware named [Kaiji](&lt;https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.kaiji&gt;) that has previously targeted [misconfigured Docker instances](&lt;https://thehackernews.com/2020/06/cryptocurrency-docker-image.html&gt;). The correlations, per Black Lotus Labs, stem from overlapping code and functions, counting that of a reverse shell module that makes it possible to run arbitrary commands on an infected device.\n\nA GitLab server located in Europe was one among the victims of the Chaos botnet in the first weeks of September, the company said, adding it identified a string of DDoS attacks aimed at entities spanning gaming, financial services, and technology, media and entertainment, and hosting providers. Also targeted was a crypto mining exchange.\n\nThe findings come exactly three months after the cybersecurity company exposed a new remote access trojan dubbed [ZuoRAT](&lt;https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/zuorat-malware-hijacking-home-office.html&gt;) that has been singling out SOHO routers as part of a sophisticated campaign directed against North American and European networks.\n\n\&quot;We are seeing a complex malware that has quadrupled in size in just two months, and it is well-positioned to continue accelerating,\&quot; said Mark Dehus, director of threat intelligence for Lumen Black Lotus Labs. \&quot;Chaos poses a threat to a variety of consumer and enterprise devices and hosts.\&quot;\n\n  \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

It said it is tracking hundreds of thousands of attempts to exploit the vulnerability in the wild.\n\nOkiku/Satori was first identified by Check Point researchers on November 23. Leading up to the discovery, researchers said they had observed a flurry of attacks worldwide against Huawei HG532 devices, with the U.S., Italy, Germany and Egypt hit the hardest.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the findings had been confirmed, the vulnerability was discretely disclosed to Huawei so as to mitigate further propagation,\u201d researchers said.\n\nOn Friday, Huawei issued an updated [security notice](&lt;http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-notices/huawei-sn-20171130-01-hg532-en&gt;) to customers warning of the vulnerability ([CVE-2017-17215](&lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17215&gt;)). It told customers the flaw allows a remote adversary to send malicious packets to port 37215 to execute remote code on vulnerable routers.\n\nThe Mirai botnet made headlines in [October 2016, targeting DNS provider Dyn](&lt;https://threatpost.com/dyn-ddos-could-have-topped-1-tbps/121609/&gt;) and the [Krebs on Security website](&lt;https://threatpost.com/iot-botnets-are-the-new-normal-of-ddos-attacks/121093/&gt;) with massive DDoS attacks. The original Mirai malware exploited flaws found in the CCTV and DVR hardware that allowed a default Linux telnet credential to be used.\n\nSince the Mirai source code became publicly available, many hackers have modified the code and expanded the number of Internet of Things devices compromised. Most have taken advantage of shoddy protections around connected devices and embedded systems.\n\nIn the case of Mirai Okiru/Satori, Check Point researchers suspected an inexperienced hacker that goes by \u201cNexus Zeta\u201d is behind the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe identity of the attacker was initially a mystery, with speculations running from advanced nation state perpetrators to notorious threat gangs,\u201d researchers said.\n\n\u201cEventually, we arrived at our main suspect; a threat actor under the nickname \u2018Nexus Zeta\u2019, who was found thanks to the email address used to register a C&amp;amp;C domain belonging to the botnet \u2013 nexusiotsolutions[.]net,\u201d they said.\n\nResearchers then cross-referenced the email addressed used for the domain registration with an email address used on the popular hacker forum called HackForums.\n\n\u201cAlthough he is rarely active in such forums, the few posts he does make disclose an amateur actor, though interesting his most recent focus was on an initiative to establish a Mirai-like IoT botnet,\u201d researchers said.\n\nOne of Nexus Zeta\u2019s post prior to the Huawei attacks was:\n\n&gt; \u201chello, im looking for someone to help me compile the mirai botnet, i heard all you have to do is compile it and you have access to 1 terabit per second so please help me setup a mirai tel-net botnet\u201d.\n\nThe Mirai Okiru/Satori attacks differs from previous Mirai variants in that they don\u2019t rely on brute-force telnet-based attacks. Instead, the new variant runs attacks over port 37215 exploiting the previously unknown [CVE-2017-17215](&lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17215&gt;) vulnerability in Huawei HG532 devices.\n\nThe attack involves a command injection, where the malicious payload is downloaded and executed on the Huawei router, researchers said.\n\nThe flaw is tied to the router\u2019s use of the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol and the TR-064 technical report standard. TR-064 is a standard designed to make it easy to add embedded UPnP devices to a local network.\n\n\u201cIn this case though, the TR-064 implementation in the Huawei devices was exposed to WAN through port 37215 (UPnP),\u201d researchers wrote. The UPnP framework supports a \u201cDeviceUpgrade\u201d that can carry out a firmware upgrade action.\n\nThe vulnerability allows remote administrators to execute arbitrary commands by injecting shell meta-characters into the DeviceUpgrade process.\n\n\u201cAfter these have been executed, the exploit returns the default HUAWEIUPNP message, and the \u2018upgrade\u2019 is initiated,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nThe payload\u2019s main purpose is to instruct the bot to flood targets with manually crafted UDP or TCP packets.\n\n\u201cThe number of packets used for the flooding action and their corresponding parameters are transmitted from the C&amp;amp;C server. Also, the C&amp;amp;C server can pass an individual IP for attack or a subnet using a subnet address and a number of valuable bits,\u201d researchers said.\n\nAccording to Huawei, mitigation against attack includes configuring the router\u2019s built-in firewall, changing the default password or using firewall at the carrier side.\n\nCheck Point said it\u2019s still unclear how the vulnerability it discovered found its way to Nexus Zeta\u2019s possession.\n\n\u201cAs seen in this case as well as others over the past year, it is clear that a combination of leaked malware code together with exploitable and poor IoT security, when used by unskilled hackers, can lead to disastrous results,\u201d Check Point said.\n&quot;, &quot;cvss3&quot;: {}, &quot;published&quot;: &quot;2017-12-22T18:09:16&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;threatpost&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Huawei Router Vulnerability Used to Spread Mirai Variant&quot;, &quot;bulletinFamily&quot;: &quot;info&quot;, &quot;cvss2&quot;: {}, &quot;cvelist&quot;: [&quot;CVE-2017-17215&quot;], &quot;modified&quot;: &quot;2017-12-22T18:09:16&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;THREATPOST:19F72FE56FF4813F1D3C849D2AB4BDAD&quot;, &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://threatpost.com/huawei-router-vulnerability-used-to-spread-mirai-variant/129238/&quot;, &quot;cvss&quot;: {&quot;score&quot;: 6.5, &quot;vector&quot;: &quot;AV:NETWORK/AC:LOW/Au:SINGLE_INSTANCE/C:PARTIAL/I:PARTIAL/A:PARTIAL/&quot;}}, {&quot;lastseen&quot;: &quot;2020-03-08T12:00:30&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;New samples of the Mirai malware have been identified, targeting an array of embedded processors and architectures within connected devices.\n\nResearchers said that they discovered new Mirai samples in February 2019, capable of infecting IoT devices running Altera Nios II, OpenRISC, Tensilica Xtensa, and Xilinx MicroBlaze processors. Variants of Mirai have previously targeted CPU architectures like ARM and x86.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the first time Mirai\u2019s targeting of new processor architectures has expanded \u2013 samples targeting Argonaut RISC Core (ARC) CPUs were discovered in [January 2018](&lt;https://twitter.com/_odisseus/status/952643252116770817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&gt;) \u2013the development shows that Mirai developers continue to expand their targets to incorporate a growing array of IoT devices, researchers with Palo Alto Network\u2019s Unit 42 group said in a [Monday post](&lt;https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/mirai-compiled-for-new-processor-surfaces/&gt;).\n\n[![](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/02/19151457/subscribe2.jpg)](&lt;https://threatpost.com/newsletter-sign/&gt;)\n\n\u201cThe addition of these processors expands the pool of potential devices which can be compromised and used for malicious activity,\u201d Jen Miller-Osborn, deputy director of threat intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, told Threatpost. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm all devices which contain these processors or why the actors chose to compile for them.\u201d\n\nXilinx\u2019s MicroBlaze processor and Altera\u2019s Nios II processors are specifically designed for field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuits. FPGAs, which allow users to program hardware circuits to optimize a chip for a particular workload, are used for IoT application application requirements due to their low power.\n\nThe Mirai samples also are capable of infecting Tensilica\u2019s Xtensa processors, which range from small low-power microcontrollers up to neural network processors; and OpenRISC project based-open source CPUs, several of which are also known to run on FPGAs.\n\n[![mirai samples ](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/04/08160552/Mirai-Sample-206x300.png)](&lt;https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/04/08160552/Mirai-Sample.png&gt;)\n\nMirai Samples\n\n\u201cExpanding Mirai-like malware to new architectures will only cause further headaches for those responsible for mitigating botnet activity,\u201d Troy Mursch, owner of Bad Packets Report, told Threatpost. \u201cGiven that the source code for Mirai has been open source for years now, this was inevitable. As for the impact of this \u2018expansion\u2019 we\u2019ll have to wait and see. DDoS attacks from Mirai-like botnets continue to plague the internet with some recently reaching nearly 40 Gbps in size.\u201d\n\nThe latest samples were discovered being hosted in an open directory on a single IP. The samples contained exploits that were known to be used in previous versions of Mirai.\n\nThat includes an exploit for a ThinkPHP remote code execution flaw, a D-Link DSL2750B OS command infection and a Netgear remote code execution glitch. Also included were exploits for CVE-2014-8361 (an arbitrary code execution flaw in Realtek SDK) and CVE-2017-17215 (a remote code execution flaw in Huawei HG532 routers).\n\n\u201cThe presence of these exploits in both previous versions of Mirai and our newly discovered samples help show the tie between the two are likely used by the same attacker in this case,\u201d researchers said.\n\nMursch said he has also seen the same exploit attempts targeting the vulnerabilities listed.\n\n\u201cThis is because the targeted devices do not get patched and become re-infected by Mirai-like malware over and over,\u201d he said. \u201cCVE-2017-17215 is notable as it was used by the [Satori botnet](&lt;https://threatpost.com/satori-author-linked-to-new-mirai-variant-masuta/129640/&gt;) and infected hundreds of thousands of Huawei devices. The author of that botnet is now under indictment by the FBI.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 22, the server was updated to hide the file listing, researchers said. A full list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are available on their [blog post](&lt;https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/mirai-compiled-for-new-processor-surfaces/&gt;).\n\nMirai is best known for being used in a massive, unprecedented DDoS attack that compromised more than 300,000 IoT devices to take down major websites [in 2016](&lt;https://threatpost.com/a-mirai-botnet-postscript-lessons-learned/130529/&gt;).\n\nVariants of Mirai continue to pop up as cybercriminals tap into a growing rate of vulnerable Internet of Things devices. In September, researchers [discovered](&lt;https://threatpost.com/mirai-gafgyt-botnets-return-to-target-infamous-apache-struts-sonicwall-flaws/137309/&gt;) new variants for the infamous Mirai and Gafgyt IoT botnets targeting well-known vulnerabilities in Apache Struts and SonicWall; and in March researchers said that [a new Mirai variant](&lt;https://threatpost.com/mirai-enterprise-systems/142889/&gt;) was targeting TV and presentation systems used by enterprises.\n\n_**Don\u2019t miss our free**_**_ _**[_**Threatpost webinar**_](&lt;https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8845482382938181378?source=ART&gt;)_**, \u201cData Security in the Cloud,\u201d on April 24 at 2 p.m. ET.**_\n\n_**A panel of experts will join Threatpost senior editor Tara Seals to discuss**_**_ _**_**how to lock down data when the traditional network perimeter is no longer in place.

Sites such as San Calvicie cater to GTA gamers who want to host their own [custom versions of GTA](&lt;https://www.gta5-mods.com/&gt;) for multiplayer action.**  \n**\n\n\u201cThe Corriente Divina (\u2018divine stream\u2019) option is described as \u2018God\u2019s wrath will be employed against the IP that you provide us,\u201d Geenens wrote of the site\u2019s DDoS offering. \u201cIt provides a DDoS service with a guaranteed bandwidth of 90-100 Gbps and attack vectors including Valve Source Engine Query and 32 bytes floods, TS3 scripts and a \u2018Down OVH\u2019 option which most probably refers to attacks targeting the hosting service of [OVH](&lt;https://www.ovh.com/&gt;), a cloud hosting provider that also was a victim of the original [Mirai](&lt;https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/10/busybox-botnet-mirai/&gt;) attacks back in September 2016. OVH is well known for hosting multi-player gaming servers such as Minecraft, which was the target of the Mirai attacks at the time.\u201d\n\nShortly after Geenens made his initial discovery, he returned to the site and found that the terms of engagement had changed. Now the listing included a reference to \u201cbots,\u201d and offered a DDoS volume of between 290 and 300 Gbps, for the same low price of $20 a pop.\n\nWhile derived from established code, the San Calvicie-hosted botnet, which Geenens has dubbed \u201cJenX\u201d, is deployed in a different manner than its predecessors.\n\n\u201cUntypical for IoT botnets we have witnessed in the past year, this botnet uses servers to perform the scanning and the exploits,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNearly all botnets, including [Mirai](&lt;https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/11/insight-into-mirais-source-code/&gt;), [Hajime](&lt;https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/hajime-futureproof-botnet/&gt;), Persirai, [Reaper](&lt;https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/iot_reaper-botnet/&gt;), Satori and Masuta perform distributed scanning and exploiting. That is, each victim that is infected with the malware will perform its own search for new victims. This distributed scanning provides for an exponential growth of the botnet, but comes at the price of flexibility and sophistication of the malware itself.\u201d\n\nThe centralized approach employed by JenX trades slower growth for lower detection, he added.\n\nThe danger from JenX should be mostly confined to GTA San Andreas users, Gessens said, but with a stern caveat.\n\n\u201c[T]here is nothing that stops one from using the cheap $20 per target service to perform 290 Gbps attacks on business targets and even government related targets,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI cannot believe the San Calvicie group would oppose to it.\u201d\n\nRadware filed abuse notifications related to JenX, resulting in a partial takedown of the botnet\u2019s server footprint, but it remains active. JenX\u2019s implementation makes taking it down a tricky task.\n\n\u201cAs they opted for a central scan and exploit paradigm, the hackers can easily move their exploit operations to bulletproof hosting providers who provide anonymous VPS and dedicated servers from offshore zones,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese providers do not care about abuse. Some are even providing hosting services from the Darknet. If the exploit servers would be move to the Darknet, it would make it much more difficult to track down the servers\u2019 location and take them down.\u201d\n&quot;, &quot;cvss3&quot;: {}, &quot;published&quot;: &quot;2018-02-02T13:32:17&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;threatpost&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;JenX Botnet Has Grand Theft Auto Hook&quot;, &quot;bulletinFamily&quot;: &quot;info&quot;, &quot;cvss2&quot;: {}, &quot;cvelist&quot;: [&quot;CVE-2014-8361&quot;, &quot;CVE-2017-17215&quot;], &quot;modified&quot;: &quot;2018-02-02T13:32:17&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;THREATPOST:D01E39B118AD961C99A79B4280C13B6A&quot;, &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://threatpost.com/jenx-botnet-has-grand-theft-auto-hook/129759/&quot;, &quot;cvss&quot;: {&quot;score&quot;: 10.0, &quot;vector&quot;: &quot;AV:NETWORK/AC:LOW/Au:NONE/C:COMPLETE/I:COMPLETE/A:COMPLETE/&quot;}}, {&quot;lastseen&quot;: &quot;2019-01-23T05:27:58&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Exploit code used in the Mirai malware variant called Satori, which was used to attack hundreds of thousands of Huawei routers over the[ past several weeks](&lt;https://threatpost.com/huawei-router-vulnerability-used-to-spread-mirai-variant/129238/&gt;), is now public. Researchers warn the code will quickly become a commodity and be leveraged in DDoS attacks via botnets such as Reaper or IOTrooper.\n\nAnkit Anubhav, researcher at NewSky Security first identified the code on Monday that was posted publicly on Pastebin.com. The code is the zero-day vulnerability CVE- 2017-17215 used by a hacker identified as \u201cNexus Zeta\u201d to spread a variant of the Mirai malware called Satori, also known as Mirai Okiru.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the code is now in the open means that more threat actors would now be using it. We can assume that the exploit would become commodity, and IoT botnets that attempt at exploiting a large kit of vulnerabilities will be adding CVE- 2017-17215 to their arsenal,\u201d said Maya Horowitz, threat intelligence group manager, Check Point.\n\n[Last week](&lt;https://threatpost.com/huawei-router-vulnerability-used-to-spread-mirai-variant/129238/&gt;), Check Point identified the vulnerability ([CVE-2017-17215](&lt;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17215&gt;)) in a Huawei home router model HG532 that was being exploited by Nexus Zeta to spread the Mirai variant Mirai Okiru/Satori. Since then Huawei issued an updated [security notice](&lt;http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-notices/huawei-sn-20171130-01-hg532-en&gt;) to customers warning the flaw allows a remote adversary to send malicious packets to port 37215 to execute remote code on vulnerable routers.\n\n\u201cThis code is now known to a variety of black hats. Just like previous SOAP exploits released for free to the public it will be used by various script kiddies and threat actors,\u201d Anubhav said. NewSky Security posted [a blog Thursday outlining its discovery](&lt;https://blog.newskysecurity.com/huawei-router-exploit-involved-in-satori-and-brickerbot-given-away-for-free-on-christmas-by-ac52fe5e4516&gt;) of the zero-day code.\n\nThe underlying cause was a bug related to SOAP, a protocol used by many IoT devices, Anubhav said. Earlier issues in SOAP (CVE-2014-8361 and TR-064 ) effected different vendors and was widely used by Mirai variants.\n\nIn the case of CVE-2017-17215, this zero day exploits how the Huawei router uses of the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol and the TR-064 technical report standard. TR-064 is a standard designed to make it easy to add embedded UPnP devices to a local network.\n\n\u201cIn this case though, the TR-064 implementation in the Huawei devices was exposed to WAN through port 37215 (UPnP),\u201d researchers wrote. The UPnP framework supports a \u201cDeviceUpgrade\u201d that can carry out a firmware upgrade action.\n\nThe vulnerability allows remote administrators to execute arbitrary commands by injecting shell meta-characters into the DeviceUpgrade process.\n\n\u201cAfter these have been executed, the exploit returns the default HUAWEIUPNP message, and the \u2018upgrade\u2019 is initiated,\u201d Check Point researchers wrote.\n\nThe payload\u2019s main purpose is to instruct the bot to flood targets with manually crafted UDP or TCP packets.\n\n\u201cThe exploit code was already used by two major IoT botnets, Brickerbot and Satori, and now that the code is public it will be incorporated into different botnet strains,\u201d Anubhav said.\n\nMitigation against attacks includes configuring a router\u2019s built-in firewall, changing the default password or using firewall at the carrier side, Huawei said.\n\n\u201cPlease note that users of this router are mostly home users, who do not typically log in to their router\u2019s interface and don\u2019t necessarily have the know-how, and so unfortunately I have to assume most devices would stay vulnerable,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cWe desperately need IoT device manufacturers to make security a top priority and not to leave the users accountable.\u201d\n&quot;, &quot;cvss3&quot;: {}, &quot;published&quot;: &quot;2017-12-28T14:01:00&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;threatpost&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Code Used in Zero Day Huawei Router Attack Made Public&quot;, &quot;bulletinFamily&quot;: &quot;info&quot;, &quot;cvss2&quot;: {}, &quot;cvelist&quot;: [&quot;CVE-2014-8361&quot;, &quot;CVE-2017-17215&quot;], &quot;modified&quot;: &quot;2017-12-28T14:01:00&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;THREATPOST:58600E628B858CCDB55A42CF867B1CF7&quot;, &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://threatpost.com/code-used-in-zero-day-huawei-router-attack-made-public/129260/&quot;, &quot;cvss&quot;: {&quot;score&quot;: 10.0, &quot;vector&quot;: &quot;AV:NETWORK/AC:LOW/Au:NONE/C:COMPLETE/I:COMPLETE/A:COMPLETE/&quot;}}, {&quot;lastseen&quot;: &quot;2021-06-14T18:09:15&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A variant of the Mirai botnet called Moobot saw a big spike in activity recently, with researchers picking up widespread scanning in their telemetry for a [known vulnerability in Tenda routers](&lt;https://threatpost.com/tenda-router-zero-days-spyware-botnet/159834/&gt;). It turns out that it was being pushed out from a new cyber-underground malware domain, known as Cyberium, which has been anchoring a large amount of Mirai-variant activity.\n\nAccording to AT&amp;amp;T Alien Labs, the scanning for vulnerable Tenda routers piqued researcher interest given that such activity is typically rare. The targeted bug is a remote code-execution (RCE) issue (CVE-2020-10987).\n\n[![](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/02/19151457/subscribe2.jpg)](&lt;https://threatpost.com/newsletter-sign/&gt;)\n\n\u201cThis spike was observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours,\u201d according to an AT&amp;amp;T analysis, [released Monday](&lt;https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/malware-hosting-domain-cyberium-fanning-out-mirai-variants&gt;). \u201cThis vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in November.\u201d\n\nFollowing the breadcrumbs of the activity, researchers tracked down the infrastructure behind the Tenda scans in late March \u2013 discovering that it was being used to scan for additional bugs, in the Axis SSI, Huawei home routers (CVE-2017-17215) and the Realtek SDK Miniigd (CVE-2014-8361). It was also deploying a DVR scanner that tried default credentials for the Sofia video application. These compromise efforts were tied to a variety of different Mirai-based botnet infections, including the [Satori botnet](&lt;https://threatpost.com/satori-botnet-creator-prison/156947/&gt;).\n\n## **Cyberium in Action**\n\nA commonality across all of the activity is that the malware deposited on compromised devices was pulled from the same malware hosting page: dns.cyberium[.]cc.\n\n\u201cWhen this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least one year to May 2020,\u201d according to AT&amp;amp;T. \u201cMost of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted several [Mirai variants](&lt;https://threatpost.com/mirai-variant-sonicwall-d-link-iot/164811/&gt;).\u201d\n\nInterestingly, each campaign had its own subdomain page below the top-level Cyberium page, and when it was completed, the subdomain became unresolvable. While active, the campaign would cycle between different Mirai variants: The same URL could be hosting Satori one day and Moobot the week after, according to AT&amp;amp;T.\n\n\u201cThe actors appear to come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cActivity in between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. Keeping a long-running existing domain while issuing a brand-new subdomain helps to divert attention to the new domain and thus distract from the original.\u201d\n\nAfter initial compromise of a targeted internet of things (IoT) device, the first request to Cyberium was for a bash script that acted like a downloader.\n\n\u201cThe script attempts to download a list of filenames (associated with different CPU architectures), executes each one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself and finally deletes itself,\u201d according to the analysis.\n\nThis script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for Mirai variants, researchers noted.\n\n## **Moobot Stampedes onto Malware Scene**\n\nMoobot was [first spotted in April 2020](&lt;https://threatpost.com/mootbot-fiber-routers-zero-days/154962/&gt;), using a pair of zero-day exploits to compromise multiple types of fiber routers. Then last October, it was seen going after vulnerable Docker APIs. In all cases, the goal is to add devices as nodes in a botnet used to carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, just like [Mirai itself](&lt;https://threatpost.com/dyn-confirms-ddos-attack-affecting-twitter-github-many-others/121438/&gt;). It isn\u2019t one of the more common variants, however.\n\nOne of the main distinctions of Moobot is a hardcoded string that\u2019s used several times throughout the code, including generating the process name to be used during execution, according to AT&amp;amp;T.\n\n\u201cThe number of samples Alien Labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last months, scattering from the original Moobot sample,\u201d AT&amp;amp;T noted. \u201cThis could potentially mean that last year\u2019s Moobots samples were used to create new branches of Mirai variants.\u201d\n\nIn a new wrinkle, the observed Moobot samples were encrypted.\n\n\u201cHowever, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a hardcoded list of IP addresses to avoid, such as: Private ranges, the Department of Defense, IANA IPs, GE, HP and others,\u201d according to the analysis.\n\n## **Cyberium: Unanswered Questions**\n\nAT&amp;amp;T found that Cyberium has been in action for the past year or so and that it appears to be active still. At the time of publication, some of the Cyberium subdomains were up, but not hosting any malware samples \u2013 potentially indicating that the pages are awaiting new requests for command-and-control server (C2) lists, according to AT&amp;amp;T.\n\nThe researchers said that the cybercriminals behind Cyberium remain somewhat mysterious.\n\n\u201cSeveral questions remain unanswered,\u201d researchers concluded. \u201cWhy would the attackers deliver different Mirai variants with different C2s on the same campaign? Are they trying to avoid anti-virus detection through diversification of variants? Or, are they trying to improve the botnet resiliency by diversifying C2.\u201d\n\n**Join Threatpost for \u201c****[Tips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting](&lt;https://threatpost.com/webinars/tips-and-tactics-for-better-threat-hunting/?utm_source=ART&amp;utm_medium=ART&amp;utm_campaign=June_PaloAltoNetworks_Webinar&gt;)****\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on ****[Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET](&lt;https://threatpost.com/webinars/tips-and-tactics-for-better-threat-hunting/?utm_source=ART&amp;utm_medium=ART&amp;utm_campaign=June_PaloAltoNetworks_Webinar&gt;)**** in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

Other gaming servers have also been targeted by the botnet, such as those hosting widely-played games such as Fortnite, researchers warn.\n\n\u201cThis Gafgyt variant is a competing botnet to the \u200b[JenX botnet](&lt;https://threatpost.com/jenx-botnet-has-grand-theft-auto-hook/129759/&gt;), which also uses remote code-execution exploits to gain access and recruit routers into botnets to attack gaming servers \u2013 most notably those running the Valve Source Engine \u2013 and cause a denial-of-service,\u201d said researchers with Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42 research team, in [analysis released Thursday](&lt;https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/home-small-office-wireless-routers-exploited-to-attack-gaming-servers/&gt;). \u201cThis variant also competes against similar botnets, which we have found are frequently sold on Instagram.\u201d\n\n[![](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/02/19151457/subscribe2.jpg)](&lt;https://threatpost.com/newsletter-sign/&gt;)\n\nGafgyt, a [botnet that was uncovered in 2014](&lt;https://threatpost.com/mirai-gafgyt-botnets-return-to-target-infamous-apache-struts-sonicwall-flaws/137309/&gt;), has become infamous for launching large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The newest Gafgyt variant targets two of the same small-office router remote-code-execution flaws as its predecessor, \u200bJenX, which was disclosed in 2018\u200b.\n\nThe two previously-targeted flaws are CVE-2017-17215 (in the Huawei HG532) and CVE-2014-8361 (in the Realtek RTL81XX chipset). However, the newest variant also targets another vulnerability, CVE-2017-18368, a remote command-injection bug on Zyxel P660HN wireless routers. The Zyxel P660HN-T1A (distributed by TrueOnline) has a command-injection vulnerability in the remote system log forwarding function, which can be accessed by an unauthenticated user, researchers said.\n\nAccording to Shodan, there are more than 32,000 Wi-Fi routers worldwide that are vulnerable to these three flaws.\n\n## Infection and DoS\n\nThe Gafgyt variant first uses three \u201cscanners\u201d to attempt to exploit these known RCE flaws. Then, depending on the type of device targeted, the botnet makes them download either an ARM7 or MIPS binary using \u201cwget,\u201d which is a computer program that pulls content from web servers.\n\nFrom there, the malware connects to a command-and-control (C2) server, sending the device\u2019s information to join the botnet, such as IP address and architecture. From there, the victim device is forced to perform at least five different types of DoS attacks.\n\n\u201cThis Gafgyt variant can perform different types of DoS attacks simultaneously depending on the commands received from the C2 server,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThemain()function of the malware calls another function called processCmd() to process the command and initiate a corresponding attack.\u201d\n\nOne such attack calls the VSE function and contains a payload to attack game servers running the Valve Source Engine. Another calls the \u200bHTTPCF function to attack services security by Cloudflare; still other options target devices that may have been previously infected with competing botnets; or, they can call the endHTTP() function to start an HTTP flooding attack.\n\n\u201cAs previously described, the \u200bVSE command starts an attack against gaming servers running the Valve Source Engine,\u201d researchers said. \u201cNote that this is not an attack on the Valve corporation itself because anyone can run a server for these games on their own network. It is an attack on the servers.\u201d\n\n## Instagram Distribution\n\nUpon further investigation, researchers found several fake Instagram profiles selling the source code for the botnet at a wide range of prices.\n\n[![Gafgyt botnet ](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/10/30162826/instagram-300x215.png)](&lt;https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/10/30162826/instagram.png&gt;)\n\nAfter going undercover and interacting with these profiles, researchers were offered a \u201cspot\u201d in the botnet servers from $8 to $150 USD. A \u201cspot\u201d means that a person can pay attackers to add a set of IP addresses against which their already-working botnets will launch a DoS attack, researchers said.\n\nResearchers say they contacted Instagram and alerted them of malicious profiles. Instagram did not respond to a request for comment from Threatpost.\n\nLooking forward, researchers said that the Gafgyt variant shows the dangers of insecure IoT devices.\n\n\u201cIn short, an increase of IoT botnets sold on Instagram + low cost + RCE exploits + the presence of wireless routers across all industries means that IoT devices are at increased risk of being recruited into botnets,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThis formula shows why every type of industry must be aware of IoT security and implement measures to prevent devices on their network from getting compromised and degrading business continuity.\u201d\n\n_**What are the top mistakes leading to data breaches at modern enterprises?

Bashlite) is a [botnet that was first uncovered in 2014](&lt;https://threatpost.com/mirai-gafgyt-botnets-return-to-target-infamous-apache-struts-sonicwall-flaws/137309/&gt;). It targets vulnerable internet of things (IoT) devices like Huawei routers, Realtek routers and ASUS devices, which it then uses to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It also often uses known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-17215 and CVE-2018-10561 to download next-stage payloads to infected devices.\n\n[![](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/02/19151457/subscribe2.jpg)](&lt;https://threatpost.com/newsletter-sign/&gt;)\n\nThe latest variants have now incorporated several Mirai-based modules, according to research from Uptycs [released Thursday](&lt;https://www.uptycs.com/blog/mirai-code-re-use-in-gafgyt&gt;), along with new exploits. Mirai variants and its code re-use have become more voluminous since the source code for the IoT botnet [was released](&lt;https://threatpost.com/source-code-released-for-mirai-ddos-malware/121039/&gt;) in October 2016.\n\nThe capabilities nicked from Mirai include various methods to carry out DDoS attacks, according to the research:\n\n  * HTTP flooding, in which the botnet sends a large number of HTTP requests to a targeted server to overwhelm it;\n  * UDP flooding, where the botnet sends several UDP packets to a victim server as a means of exhausting it;\n  * Various TCP flood attacks, which exploit a normal three-way TCP handshake the victim server receives a heavy number of requests, resulting in the server becoming unresponsive;\n  * And an STD module, which sends a random string (from a hardcoded array of strings) to a particular IP address.\n\n![](https://media.threatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2021/04/15120709/mirai-gafgyt.jpg)\n\nCode comparison for the HTTP DDoS module between Gafgyt and Mirai. Click to enlarge. Source: Uptycs.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest versions of Gafgyt contain new approaches for achieving initial compromise of IoT devices, Uptycs found; this is the first step in turning infected devices into bots to later perform DDoS attacks on specifically targeted IP addresses. These include a Mirai-copied module for Telnet brute-forcing, and additional exploits for existing vulnerabilities in Huawei, Realtek and GPON devices.\n\nThe Huawei exploit ([CVE-2017-17215](&lt;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17215&gt;)) and the Realtek exploit ([CVE-2014-8361](&lt;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-8361&gt;)) are both used for remote code execution (RCE), to fetch and download the Gafgyt payload, according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe Gafgyt malware binary embeds RCE exploits for Huawei and Realtek routers, by which the malware binary, using \u2018wget\u2019 command, fetches the payload,\u201d according to Uptycs. \u201c[It] gives the execution permission to payload using \u2018chmod\u2019 command, [and] executes the payload.\u201d\n\nThe GPON exploit ([CVE-2018-10561](&lt;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10561&gt;)) is used for authentication bypass in vulnerable Dasan GPON routers; here, the malware binary follows the same process, but can also remove the payload on command.\n\n\u201cThe IP addresses used for fetching the payloads were generally the open directories where malicious payloads for different architectures were hosted by the attacker,\u201d researchers added.\n\n## **IoT Botnet Variants Abound**\n\nIoT botnets like Gafgyt are constantly evolving. For instance, researchers in March discovered what they said is the first variant of the Gafgyt botnet family [to cloak its activity](&lt;https://threatpost.com/d-link-iot-tor-gafgyt-variant/164529/&gt;) using the Tor network.\n\nMirai hasn\u2019t disappeared either: a [new variant of the botnet](&lt;https://threatpost.com/mirai-variant-sonicwall-d-link-iot/164811/&gt;) was recently discovered targeting a slew of vulnerabilities in unpatched D-Link, Netgear and SonicWall devices. Since mid-February, the variant has been targeting six known vulnerabilities \u2013 and three previously unknown ones \u2013 in order to infect systems and add them to a botnet.\n\nIt\u2019s only the latest variant of Mirai [to come to light](&lt;https://threatpost.com/new-mirai-variant-mukashi-targets-zyxel-nas-devices/153982/&gt;). Last year, a version dubbed Mukashi was seen taking advantage of a pre-authentication command-injection vulnerability found in Zyxel NAS storage devices.\n\n\u201cMalware authors may not always innovate, and researchers often discover that malware authors copy and re-use leaked malware source code,\u201d Uptycs researchers said.\n\nTo protect against these kinds of botnet infections, users should regularly monitor for suspicious processes, events and network traffic spawned on the execution of any untrusted binary, researchers recommended. And, users should keep all systems and firmware updated with the latest releases and patches.\n\n**_Ever wonder what goes on in underground cybercrime forums?
