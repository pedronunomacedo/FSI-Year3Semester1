Instructions to run the SEEDS Labs on cloud using Microsoft Azure

1 - Start the cloud virtual machine in the Microsoft Azure (online).

2 - Open the terminal in the folder where the "SEED-Labs_key.pem" is located.

3 - Run the command "chmod 400 SEED-Labs_key.pem".

4 - Next, run the command "ssh -i SEED-Labs_key.pem seed@<public port>". In my case, the public port is 51.145.142.119, but you can find it in the VM definitions (on your virtual machines in Microsoft Azure).

5 - Run the command "cd /mnt/qsfileshare" on the Linux terminal (terminal opened in the previous step).

6 - Run the commmand "cd seed-labs/" to go to the SEED Labs directory.

7 - And there you have the files.

How to put a folder in the Linux Microsoft Azure VM?

1 - Run the following command in the Mac terminal "open smb://ssedlabs:CIcMev1KoK8o2gdXluc%2BAWo%2FhV7qhuBBel5rrxjNYLcqw6Z5voU%2BMPkErkiHeXRzruckoVBt%2BKUi%2BAStJLgk9A%3D%3D@ssedlabs.file.core.windows.net/qsfileshare".

2 - If it takes too long to connect to the server, it may be the internet connection (in my case, the university internet connection was too slow). Connect to your personal hotspot.

3 - After doing the step 2 (if its successful), it will open the finder app in the VM shared folder.

4 - And there you can put your files and access them in the Linux VM.

NOTE: It can be really slow to copy files/folders to the shared folder. Just wait!


If the shared folder is not appearing on the terminal, do this:

1 - In the ubuntu terminal (in the Microsoft Azure VM), do the command "cd /mnt".

2 - Go to the shared folder on Microsoft Azure, click on the folder you want to share. In the top menu, click on Connect.

3 - Then, in the right-side menu that will appear, click on Linux.

4 - Click on "Show Script".

5 - Copy the script and paste it on the Ubuntu terminal (on the VM Azure terminal).

6 - And then try to enter the shared folder again!
